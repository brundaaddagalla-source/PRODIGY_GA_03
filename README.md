# PRODIGY_GA_03

This project demonstrates text generation using a Markov Chain algorithm built with the markovify library. 
An interactive ipywidgets-based interface allows users to enter a starting word for the prompt.

Features:
- Uses Markov Chains for text generation
- Large datasets are taken as input from wikipedia
- Interactive UI built using ipywidgets
- Users can give starting word for the prompt

Dataset:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Data Science
- Information Retrieval

How it works:
- The wikikpedia content is collected and combined into one single text
- A markov chain model is trained using markovify
- Users can either enter an optional word and choose the number of sentences
- The model generates the text based upon the input given by the user
